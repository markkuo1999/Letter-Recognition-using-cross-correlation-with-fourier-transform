# Letter-Recognition-using-cross-correlation-with-fourier-transfrom

1. CrossCorrelation_FFT: Do cross-correlation on an image. Then, detect specific letter on the image, drawing a rectangular bounding box in the original scene image.
Also, I tried cross-correlation using fourier transform to increase the speed.

2. Auto-correlation: Perform auto-correlation to a 2D noise image.

The work above is done by matlab.
